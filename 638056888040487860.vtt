NOTE Confidence: 0.827630341053009

00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:02.535
From a free kick in a World Cup final. Glad

NOTE Confidence: 0.827630341053009

00:00:02.589 --> 00:00:05.699
you listened to me, sometimes, rightly anyway, it's a kick

NOTE Confidence: 0.827630341053009

00:00:05.752 --> 00:00:08.487
off here for Brazil. We're about to start the World

NOTE Confidence: 0.827630341053009

00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:10.846
Cup final of 2002, the first one of the new

NOTE Confidence: 0.827630341053009

00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:14.385
century, and it's Brazil straight away from the kickoff pressing.

NOTE Confidence: 0.827630341053009

00:00:14.439 --> 00:00:17.280
Forward Trevor Brooking has had a chance to speak yet

NOTE Confidence: 0.827630341053009

00:00:17.334 --> 00:00:20.819
from earlier in the tournament, otherwise he wouldn't have played

NOTE Confidence: 0.827630341053009

00:00:20.873 --> 00:00:22.750
in this final, rather like Ballack.

NOTE Confidence: 0.7079684734344482

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:27.084
Now then, cleverson for Brazil, Ronaldinho coming in from the

NOTE Confidence: 0.7079684734344482

00:00:27.139 --> 00:00:27.630
far side.

NOTE Confidence: 0.642440140247345

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:31.010
Been taken cleanly by Khan.

NOTE Confidence: 0.449288934469223

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:37.950
And when they fooled them here, Norville.

NOTE Confidence: 0.7341923117637634

00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:41.620
Could have gone anywhere. Really. Can't Brazil smuggle it?

NOTE Confidence: 0.7341923117637634

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:44.261
Away up there for a set piece Germany they could

NOTE Confidence: 0.7341923117637634

00:00:44.316 --> 00:00:46.400
just create that one opportunity that.

NOTE Confidence: 0.7341923117637634

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:49.240
Could be crucial, and so could Brazil cleverson.

NOTE Confidence: 0.42076575756073

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:53.620
Him.

NOTE Confidence: 0.6618065237998962

00:00:56.630 --> 00:01:00.457
By Schneider as well could play by Germany. Closer is

NOTE Confidence: 0.6618065237998962

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:04.285
in the middle and side closes there. Ohh well closer

NOTE Confidence: 0.6618065237998962

00:01:04.357 --> 00:01:05.080
was close.

NOTE Confidence: 0.6618065237998962

00:01:05.130 --> 00:01:08.080
Fantastic defending my admission that #5.

NOTE Confidence: 0.625072717666626

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:10.930
This is closure.

NOTE Confidence: 0.7003085017204285

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:18.240
Schneider did well closer under, no evil in the middle.

NOTE Confidence: 0.715054452419281

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:22.468
Ohh, one closer goes in. It's a goal kick. Or

NOTE Confidence: 0.715054452419281

00:01:22.533 --> 00:01:25.668
is it? No, it's a corner advantage played by the

NOTE Confidence: 0.715054452419281

00:01:25.733 --> 00:01:29.782
referee and it was Ronaldinho who took advantage and Ronaldo's

NOTE Confidence: 0.715054452419281

00:01:29.847 --> 00:01:30.370
in here.

NOTE Confidence: 0.7797301411628723

00:01:33.970 --> 00:01:36.119
And you had to look twice to make sure he'd

NOTE Confidence: 0.7797301411628723

00:01:36.169 --> 00:01:36.519
missed.

NOTE Confidence: 0.7797301411628723

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:40.202
Well, that was just the situation. Brazil had waited well,

NOTE Confidence: 0.7797301411628723

00:01:40.255 --> 00:01:43.561
opening 20 minutes for terrific ball from Ronaldinho. And what

NOTE Confidence: 0.7797301411628723

00:01:43.615 --> 00:01:45.961
does he hit it with? The outside of his left

NOTE Confidence: 0.7797301411628723

00:01:46.014 --> 00:01:48.627
foot. He seems like he's got caught in two minds.

NOTE Confidence: 0.7797301411628723

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:50.919
Shall I shoot from guys? He's weaker foot.

NOTE Confidence: 0.7059291005134583

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:57.005
And it was Boda who came in at the back

NOTE Confidence: 0.7059291005134583

00:01:57.084 --> 00:02:01.093
and met Zelda still in there, Brazil once again not

NOTE Confidence: 0.7059291005134583

00:02:01.171 --> 00:02:03.529
clearing comfortably near the.

NOTE Confidence: 0.7059291005134583

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:04.140
Halfway line.

NOTE Confidence: 0.7059291005134583

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:07.748
On the halfway line, here he is again, Ronald. This

NOTE Confidence: 0.7059291005134583

00:02:07.806 --> 00:02:10.658
is Ronald Denio and Ronaldo is in here for Brazil

NOTE Confidence: 0.7059291005134583

00:02:10.716 --> 00:02:13.218
and Oliver Kahn is able to make the save at

NOTE Confidence: 0.7059291005134583

00:02:13.277 --> 00:02:14.150
rinaldo's feet.

NOTE Confidence: 0.7749420404434204

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:18.145
That's where they want him, right near the penalty here.

NOTE Confidence: 0.7749420404434204

00:02:18.195 --> 00:02:21.130
You've got to say, it's been a scrappy performance. Brazil,

NOTE Confidence: 0.7749420404434204

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:23.270
though, I've had two golden opportunities.

NOTE Confidence: 0.5681307315826416

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:28.440
And now you'll miss the shots on for yen jeremies.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8124452829360962

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:34.300
How many scored once in 30 yet to solve the

NOTE Confidence: 0.8124452829360962

00:02:34.371 --> 00:02:34.869
puzzle?

NOTE Confidence: 0.5731966495513916

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:39.890
Over his cleverson for Brazil. He's right in here, cleberson.

NOTE Confidence: 0.6631134152412415

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:45.190
I'm afraid Cleberson rather clobbered the shot.

NOTE Confidence: 0.6631134152412415

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:47.550
On his left foot.

NOTE Confidence: 0.4766543507575989

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:51.380
First indecision, I mean I think the two free.

NOTE Confidence: 0.4766543507575989

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:52.330
Ronaldinho.

NOTE Confidence: 0.6269248723983765

00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:59.780
Cleverson now always hit the ball.

NOTE Confidence: 0.7145410776138306

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:05.660
A breathtaking effort from Cleberson, but Khan can breathe again.

NOTE Confidence: 0.7241474986076355

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:09.511
Well, on his right foot they proved away, didn't they?

NOTE Confidence: 0.7241474986076355

00:03:09.562 --> 00:03:12.040
Worked out to the left. They knocked it into that

NOTE Confidence: 0.7241474986076355

00:03:12.091 --> 00:03:12.849
dangerous area.

NOTE Confidence: 0.7241474986076355

00:03:12.919 --> 00:03:18.468
Ohh survived another scare, Ronaldinho back to Roberto Carlos driving

NOTE Confidence: 0.7241474986076355

00:03:18.548 --> 00:03:22.729
Lower Cross. Anybody's fault would save on the card.

NOTE Confidence: 0.731899619102478

00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:26.480
From Ronaldo again.

NOTE Confidence: 0.7728928327560425

00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:31.223
This is a personal tussle now between the goalkeeper and

NOTE Confidence: 0.7728928327560425

00:03:31.289 --> 00:03:34.463
the top scorer as the whistle goes for half time

NOTE Confidence: 0.7728928327560425

00:03:34.529 --> 00:03:37.637
and Khan has won it at the moment. Whether it's

NOTE Confidence: 0.7728928327560425

00:03:37.703 --> 00:03:41.473
handle, that's the cleverson effort off the bar, but just

NOTE Confidence: 0.7728928327560425

00:03:41.539 --> 00:03:41.869
then.

NOTE Confidence: 0.7788957953453064

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:46.552
Card on this occasion was beaten but on the other

NOTE Confidence: 0.7788957953453064

00:03:46.621 --> 00:03:50.706
three occasions that mattered he got the better of Ronaldo.

NOTE Confidence: 0.7788957953453064

00:03:50.776 --> 00:03:53.891
This was a ball in by Roberto Carlos right on

NOTE Confidence: 0.7788957953453064

00:03:53.960 --> 00:03:57.699
half time. The defender doesn't really get hold of it.

NOTE Confidence: 0.7788957953453064

00:03:57.768 --> 00:04:00.399
There metzelder and it was Khan again.

NOTE Confidence: 0.7788957953453064

00:04:00.770 --> 00:04:04.222
Excellent on the ball, you know, pushing forward more, trying

NOTE Confidence: 0.7788957953453064

00:04:04.279 --> 00:04:06.996
to get a grip and control into the midfield area

NOTE Confidence: 0.7788957953453064

00:04:07.053 --> 00:04:10.166
and certainly the supply. Then it's gonna be better for

NOTE Confidence: 0.7788957953453064

00:04:10.222 --> 00:04:12.939
the likes of Ronaldo, Ronaldinho and Rivaldo so.

NOTE Confidence: 0.7884745001792908

00:04:13.460 --> 00:04:16.153
Brazil beat Oliver Kahn. That's the big question. At the

NOTE Confidence: 0.7884745001792908

00:04:16.201 --> 00:04:19.136
beginning of the second-half. He's only conceded one goal, as

NOTE Confidence: 0.7884745001792908

00:04:19.184 --> 00:04:20.819
I said in the championship so far.

NOTE Confidence: 0.7865468263626099

00:04:24.470 --> 00:04:24.680
Oh.

NOTE Confidence: 0.5662856698036194

00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:27.830
Well, it was your Amis.

NOTE Confidence: 0.6266292333602905

00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:29.640
And.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8072242736816406

00:04:30.700 --> 00:04:33.700
Everybody seemed to just stand still and gasp there.

NOTE Confidence: 0.625361979007721

00:04:34.830 --> 00:04:35.640
Brazil is.

NOTE Confidence: 0.15537607669830322

00:04:37.910 --> 00:04:38.460
Wow.

NOTE Confidence: 0.5320841670036316

00:04:40.190 --> 00:04:44.308
But this looks like the Norville and it is Norville

NOTE Confidence: 0.5320841670036316

00:04:44.389 --> 00:04:46.569
Ohh and they hit the toast.

NOTE Confidence: 0.6886791586875916

00:04:47.420 --> 00:04:48.310
Germany.

NOTE Confidence: 0.6886791586875916

00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:51.628
Well, I couldn't believe that he was going to shoot

NOTE Confidence: 0.6886791586875916

00:04:51.673 --> 00:04:53.956
from that distance and get the power, but look, he

NOTE Confidence: 0.6886791586875916

00:04:54.001 --> 00:04:56.558
goes round swerving with the outside and the faintest of

NOTE Confidence: 0.6886791586875916

00:04:56.604 --> 00:04:58.932
touches by Marcos onto the post. St Ronaldo tried a

NOTE Confidence: 0.6886791586875916

00:04:58.977 --> 00:05:00.530
couple step overs but he couldn't.

NOTE Confidence: 0.6886791586875916

00:05:00.540 --> 00:05:03.683
Sell the damn played short to Roberto Carlos, said Nielsens.

NOTE Confidence: 0.6886791586875916

00:05:03.736 --> 00:05:05.779
Arriving. Aren't Carnas saved it again.

NOTE Confidence: 0.694689154624939

00:05:06.720 --> 00:05:09.410
Unbelievably from Gilberto Silva, I think.

NOTE Confidence: 0.538959801197052

00:05:12.140 --> 00:05:13.120
Fantastic save.

NOTE Confidence: 0.7379676103591919

00:05:15.820 --> 00:05:19.361
Drifted it the better Carlos towards the far post. Two

NOTE Confidence: 0.7379676103591919

00:05:19.427 --> 00:05:22.575
of them coming in and he's really got, but there

NOTE Confidence: 0.7379676103591919

00:05:22.640 --> 00:05:25.919
he is. Rivaldo is the first man, but it's cheaper.

NOTE Confidence: 0.6863685846328735

00:05:28.810 --> 00:05:29.560
Oh well, haha.

NOTE Confidence: 0.6979369521141052

00:05:34.410 --> 00:05:34.620
Wow.

NOTE Confidence: 0.5961424112319946

00:05:35.560 --> 00:05:38.810
Deep mahaman, the last man to score at Wembley. Poo.

NOTE Confidence: 0.4130497872829437

00:05:40.450 --> 00:05:41.730
Ronaldinho always that.

NOTE Confidence: 0.720940887928009

00:05:45.100 --> 00:05:48.125
That's the six year old box ahead of Ronaldo and

NOTE Confidence: 0.720940887928009

00:05:48.188 --> 00:05:49.890
Rivaldo. This is Schneider.

NOTE Confidence: 0.4958805441856384

00:05:53.120 --> 00:05:54.770
Most stretching there was Neuville.

NOTE Confidence: 0.780852735042572

00:05:56.940 --> 00:06:00.226
Was unlucky. Schneider worked the opportunity well. This clipped in

NOTE Confidence: 0.780852735042572

00:06:00.275 --> 00:06:02.776
probably is a little bit. For now, they'll just try

NOTE Confidence: 0.780852735042572

00:06:02.825 --> 00:06:04.689
to hook it and help it on, but it went

NOTE Confidence: 0.780852735042572

00:06:04.738 --> 00:06:06.994
too fast and it was passed him before he could

NOTE Confidence: 0.780852735042572

00:06:07.043 --> 00:06:07.730
get the touch.

NOTE Confidence: 0.780852735042572

00:06:07.740 --> 00:06:08.520
So it's to his right.

NOTE Confidence: 0.7858428955078125

00:06:09.350 --> 00:06:12.880
But again, Ronaldo just runs into trouble. This is Harman.

NOTE Confidence: 0.7858428955078125

00:06:12.941 --> 00:06:14.220
Ronaldo wins it back.

NOTE Confidence: 0.722321629524231

00:06:14.920 --> 00:06:16.710
Now, can he find Rivaldo? Yes, he can.

NOTE Confidence: 0.770927906036377

00:06:30.420 --> 00:06:34.391
And a stake by Oliver Kahn. After all the great

NOTE Confidence: 0.770927906036377

00:06:34.475 --> 00:06:38.784
saves he's made and the man who pounces is Ronaldo.

NOTE Confidence: 0.770927906036377

00:06:38.869 --> 00:06:43.262
With his seventh goal of the tournament and his 11th

NOTE Confidence: 0.770927906036377

00:06:43.347 --> 00:06:47.994
in World Cup finals. Rivaldo has the shot can't fumbles

NOTE Confidence: 0.770927906036377

00:06:48.079 --> 00:06:52.134
and Ronaldo makes up the 1998 by steering in the

NOTE Confidence: 0.770927906036377

00:06:52.219 --> 00:06:55.429
rebound. It's Brazil won, Germany nil.

NOTE Confidence: 0.6308947205543518

00:06:57.600 --> 00:07:01.110
What an irony. Khan has been magnificent spills it.

NOTE Confidence: 0.6308947205543518

00:07:01.760 --> 00:07:04.424
The two hours to his left, or two of the

NOTE Confidence: 0.6308947205543518

00:07:04.491 --> 00:07:08.022
three, I should say Ronaldinho has dropped back a bit

NOTE Confidence: 0.6308947205543518

00:07:08.089 --> 00:07:11.619
here. Clevis. Redondos, dummy. Ronaldo, it's two you.

NOTE Confidence: 0.6650661826133728

00:07:13.400 --> 00:07:15.220
Well, there was rampant now.

NOTE Confidence: 0.41178077459335327

00:07:16.780 --> 00:07:18.520
Resplendent Ronaldo.

NOTE Confidence: 0.6253887414932251

00:07:22.250 --> 00:07:22.980
True for him.

NOTE Confidence: 0.6970441341400146

00:07:23.910 --> 00:07:24.990
Turn for Brazil?

NOTE Confidence: 0.8343406319618225

00:07:25.680 --> 00:07:28.070
And is that their fifth World Cup?

NOTE Confidence: 0.6681072115898132

00:07:29.460 --> 00:07:35.052
79 minutes gone. It's Brazil to Germany, nil, and Khan

NOTE Confidence: 0.6681072115898132

00:07:35.156 --> 00:07:36.710
is crestfallen.

NOTE Confidence: 0.7256143093109131

00:07:38.100 --> 00:07:40.640
That's great goal. They just know how to suck you.

NOTE Confidence: 0.7256143093109131

00:07:40.650 --> 00:07:41.920
In and now linker.

NOTE Confidence: 0.572138249874115

00:07:44.470 --> 00:07:48.414
This is Torsten Frings ohh chance. Great save by Marcos

NOTE Confidence: 0.572138249874115

00:07:48.485 --> 00:07:49.489
of Oliver Bio.

NOTE Confidence: 0.7235729694366455

00:07:50.690 --> 00:07:54.062
Was the great save well played their firings. He knocked

NOTE Confidence: 0.7235729694366455

00:07:54.122 --> 00:07:56.109
it in and on the swivel beer off.

NOTE Confidence: 0.7235729694366455

00:07:56.120 --> 00:07:58.910
The free kick, though, to German. And there's danger here

NOTE Confidence: 0.7235729694366455

00:07:58.959 --> 00:08:01.309
and Marcos is caught out. He started to come and

NOTE Confidence: 0.7235729694366455

00:08:01.358 --> 00:08:02.679
he wouldn't have got there.

NOTE Confidence: 0.6700539588928223

00:08:03.770 --> 00:08:06.655
Juninho did well there, he's away, he's got Rivaldo to

NOTE Confidence: 0.6700539588928223

00:08:06.709 --> 00:08:09.648
his left and Rinaldo's further over and he's played the

NOTE Confidence: 0.6700539588928223

00:08:09.702 --> 00:08:10.289
wrong ball.

NOTE Confidence: 0.7367064952850342

00:08:11.400 --> 00:08:13.629
I think it was a right. Paul was a bad

NOTE Confidence: 0.7367064952850342

00:08:13.687 --> 00:08:16.210
boy. He was trying to square it to Rivaldo.

NOTE Confidence: 0.7367064952850342

00:08:16.220 --> 00:08:18.978
Coach just running down the clock a bit here with

NOTE Confidence: 0.7367064952850342

00:08:19.034 --> 00:08:22.300
another substitute and Ronaldo actually will not be on the

NOTE Confidence: 0.7367064952850342

00:08:22.356 --> 00:08:23.819
field when the match ends.

NOTE Confidence: 0.7485538721084595

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:29.274
But there's a raw going up to greet his departure

NOTE Confidence: 0.7485538721084595

00:08:29.341 --> 00:08:33.151
and Danielsen takes his place. The Brazilian Subs are off

NOTE Confidence: 0.7485538721084595

00:08:33.217 --> 00:08:37.428
the bench. They're waving, screaming for the final whistle. The

NOTE Confidence: 0.7485538721084595

00:08:37.495 --> 00:08:40.703
play goes on. Rivaldo is in the centre. Janini O

NOTE Confidence: 0.7485538721084595

00:08:40.770 --> 00:08:42.039
is backing up here.

NOTE Confidence: 0.5775312781333923

00:08:42.860 --> 00:08:43.880
This is danielsen.

NOTE Confidence: 0.5065563917160034

00:08:45.720 --> 00:08:47.300
Little backheel to Julio.

NOTE Confidence: 0.786135733127594

00:08:51.470 --> 00:08:54.080
And I make the three minutes now. Have you latched?

NOTE Confidence: 0.7940833568572998

00:08:55.470 --> 00:08:58.832
But Danielson doesn't want to know about that. He's trying

NOTE Confidence: 0.7940833568572998

00:08:58.890 --> 00:09:01.672
to go past Asamoa now. He's the referee going to

NOTE Confidence: 0.7940833568572998

00:09:01.730 --> 00:09:04.513
pick up the ball and sell the final whistle, and

NOTE Confidence: 0.7940833568572998

00:09:04.571 --> 00:09:07.180
he does. And Brazil win the World Cup for the

NOTE Confidence: 0.7940833568572998

00:09:07.238 --> 00:09:07.759
5th time.

NOTE Confidence: 0.7499815225601196

00:09:09.100 --> 00:09:13.353
And Ronaldo, the woebegone figure of four years ago, is

NOTE Confidence: 0.7499815225601196

00:09:13.431 --> 00:09:15.210
now a World Cup winner.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8458813428878784

00:09:17.230 --> 00:09:20.955
In France, he made headlines because he's been in hospital

NOTE Confidence: 0.8458813428878784

00:09:21.019 --> 00:09:23.459
tonight. He makes headlines as a hero.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8202334642410278

00:09:25.010 --> 00:09:29.660
Scoring the two goals by which Brazil beat Germany.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9370762705802917

00:09:31.230 --> 00:09:34.307
In the first ever World Cup meeting between the two

NOTE Confidence: 0.9370762705802917

00:09:34.367 --> 00:09:34.850
nations.

NOTE Confidence: 0.7318331003189087

00:09:40.140 --> 00:09:42.310
Oliver Kahn is distraught.

NOTE Confidence: 0.7602514028549194

00:09:44.160 --> 00:09:48.910
Brazil are delighted, their supporters are delirious.

NOTE Confidence: 0.7848299145698547

00:09:51.420 --> 00:09:57.642
Spontaneous skill still stirs the soul for football lovers everywhere,

NOTE Confidence: 0.7848299145698547

00:09:57.731 --> 00:10:02.442
and, well, no wonder they're carrying him up on their

NOTE Confidence: 0.7848299145698547

00:10:02.531 --> 00:10:03.419
shoulders.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8096338510513306

00:10:04.970 --> 00:10:07.470
Watch a story got finished at the World Cup.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8488819599151611

00:10:13.460 --> 00:10:16.861
Well, they were beginning to say it was the tournament

NOTE Confidence: 0.8488819599151611

00:10:16.924 --> 00:10:19.947
of the underdog, but Ronaldo is top dog and he's

NOTE Confidence: 0.8488819599151611

00:10:20.010 --> 00:10:23.663
also top scorer with eight in the championship, the winner

NOTE Confidence: 0.8488819599151611

00:10:23.726 --> 00:10:26.813
of the Golden Boot, the best record for a striker

NOTE Confidence: 0.8488819599151611

00:10:26.876 --> 00:10:28.010
for over 30 years.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8344509601593018

00:10:29.700 --> 00:10:33.649
And indeed, the first time since 1970 since the brilliant

NOTE Confidence: 0.8344509601593018

00:10:33.718 --> 00:10:37.252
Brazilians won an A World Cup final in normal time.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8344509601593018

00:10:37.321 --> 00:10:38.429
Trevor Brooking.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8065264225006104

00:10:40.040 --> 00:10:42.210
Well, great celebrations and.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8065264225006104

00:10:42.460 --> 00:10:42.990
Nobody.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8065264225006104

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:45.938
Could begrudge Ronaldo that. I mean, when you think of

NOTE Confidence: 0.8065264225006104

00:10:45.993 --> 00:10:48.660
what he went through four years ago, that when we

NOTE Confidence: 0.8065264225006104

00:10:48.714 --> 00:10:52.088
scurried around that commentary position because he was in and

NOTE Confidence: 0.8065264225006104

00:10:52.143 --> 00:10:54.918
out and then he was in, never ever really recovered

NOTE Confidence: 0.8065264225006104

00:10:54.973 --> 00:10:57.803
over the last three or four years, and suddenly he's

NOTE Confidence: 0.8065264225006104

00:10:57.857 --> 00:11:00.469
going to be in the headlines all over the world.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8065264225006104

00:11:01.320 --> 00:11:04.400
Well, that's certainly true. And just one little thing here,

NOTE Confidence: 0.8065264225006104

00:11:04.451 --> 00:11:07.121
little point is that Brazil also make a little piece

NOTE Confidence: 0.8065264225006104

00:11:07.172 --> 00:11:10.150
of history now from their point of view, it's unfortunate.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8190178275108337

00:11:10.230 --> 00:11:13.728
They do not qualify automatically for the next World Cup

NOTE Confidence: 0.8190178275108337

00:11:13.790 --> 00:11:17.289
by being holders. The rules have been changed. They will

NOTE Confidence: 0.8190178275108337

00:11:17.351 --> 00:11:20.849
have to qualify once all these celebrations die down and

NOTE Confidence: 0.8190178275108337

00:11:20.912 --> 00:11:25.035
Germany has hosts next time have automatic qualification. That's a

NOTE Confidence: 0.8190178275108337

00:11:25.097 --> 00:11:28.158
slight back to front end to the evening, but just

NOTE Confidence: 0.8190178275108337

00:11:28.221 --> 00:11:29.033
look at this.
